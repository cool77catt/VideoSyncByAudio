# Overview

Playground project to test various libraries and algorithms for syncing video clips in time through audio.

# Findings

* Next - run the signal through a small bandpass - if can focus in ust 1 small band, assuming all clips have that band, it might significantly reduce the noise

* librosa is a python library for music and audio analysis

* synctoolbox - python library that wraps around librosa (https://meinardmueller.github.io/synctoolbox/build/html/index.html)s

* Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)
